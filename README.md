# Saturn Project

The Saturn Project is a dynamic, multi-layered security system designed to offer maximum protection by periodically changing device locations, IP addresses, and digital identifiers. It automatically isolates and rebuilds compromised layers, ensuring continuous security.

# Time
to complete this project maybe will take from me around 2-3 month of hard working

## Description

The Saturn Project provides advanced security by dynamically altering device geolocation, IP addresses, and identifiers to maintain anonymity and prevent tracking. It detects breaches in security layers, isolates compromised sections, and rebuilds them automatically, ensuring continuous, robust protection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/ITzAD20/SATURN-PROJECT.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python saturn.py
    ```

## Usage

- Access the **Dashboard** for real-time device status and security layer summary.
- Customize settings like **Geolocation**, **IP Masking**, and **Alerts**.
- View **Logs** for network activity and suspicious incidents.

## Features

- **Dynamic Geolocation**: Automatically changes the deviceâ€™s virtual location.
- **IP Masking**: Assigns and updates IP addresses to protect the device's identity.
- **Digital Address Masking**: Alters MAC addresses and other identifiers for anonymity.
- **Automated Isolation**: Detects breaches and isolates compromised layers.
- **Layer Rebuilding**: Recreates compromised layers for continuous protection.

## Technologies Will Be Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS
- **Database**: SQLite or MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Networking Protocols**: TCP/IP, HTTP
